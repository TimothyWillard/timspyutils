# Tim's Python Utilities

This is a personal package with a collection of useful utilities I like to carry with me from project to project. It's MIT licensed so feel free to use, fork, or make suggestions.

## Things I Should Implement Here

* The Fourier function wrapper around ~~numpy~~ scipy interface
* Schodinger equation solver interface, using scipy's ode solving capabilities
* Wrapper around some of the scipy.stats distributions to have fit testing and fitting together and other convienences
* coordinate system transforms
* convienence functions that make it easier to write stuff like a physicist or mathematican instead of as a computer scientist
* Plotting functions (like science plot with units and labels or a 3D plot wrapper)
* ~~Numerically solve SDE by using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` and kernal density estimation, and run for a whole bunch of trials~~
* NPZ to csv and visa versa because that would be handy
* n-D power series generating and fitting, plus methods for saving, reading, integrating, differentiating
* method to calculate distance between GPS coordinates using heaviside formula
* Sommerfeld expansion
* Dilogarithm
* n-point stencil for m-th derivative generator
* binary index grid sort array
